# AutoMediaPlayer
A media player which supports picture, music and video
The project is mainly based on <a href = "https://capricasoftware.co.uk/projects/vlcj">vclj</a>.It supports many kinds of media and work well. However, I think the vclj's API is sometimes terrible. Its new version not support the previous one. And there are few articles in the Internet about it compared with C#. All in all, thanks a lot for it.
